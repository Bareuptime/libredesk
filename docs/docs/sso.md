# Setting up SSO

You can use external OpenID Providers like Google, Keycloak, ... to allow your users to sign into Libredesk.

!!! Keep in mind
    You still have to create the user accounts in Libredesk, they do not get created automatically.

## Keycloak

1. Go to your keycloak admin console and create a new client.
2. xxxxx

## Other providers

You can use them, but there is currently no documentation for it. Feel free to change that!
